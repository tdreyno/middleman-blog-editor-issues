# Middleman Blog Editor

Middleman Blog Editor is a [paid](http://register.tdreyno.com) extension to [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com) which adds WYSIWYG article editing and a blog organization interface.

This extension makes it possible to host a Middleman Blog and give the editor URL to a client so they can add content. Files are modified in-place, so committing those changes to source control or deploying new builds is up to you.
